Which Concurrent Hash Maps?

There are several open source java collection libraries which provide concurrent hash map functionality. But which one is faster and suitable for a low latency application?

In this text, following concurrent hash map classes are considered:

- ConcurrentHashMap by Oracle (JDK 8)
- ConcurrentHashMap and ConcurrentHashMapUnsafe by Goldman Sachs (GS) Collection (6.1.0) 
- FastMap by Javolution (6.0.0)
- ConcurrentHashMap by Guava (18.0)
